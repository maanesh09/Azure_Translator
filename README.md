# Azure_Translator

# Description

this project serves the purpose of translating texts from one language to multiple other languages.
In this we are using Translator a cloud-based neural machine translation service that is part of the Azure Cognitive Services family of REST APIs.
Through this text based communication between people belonging to different languages and articles of different languages  are made easier to understand.



# Use of Translator, part of Azure Cognitive Services in this Project 

Translator, part of Azure Cognitive Services, is a cloud-based machine translation service that can be used to build applications, websites, tools,
or any solution requiring multi-language support. Built for business, Translator is a proven, customizable, and scalable technology for machine translation.
Translator also comes equipped with additional features to provide increased value in multilingual apps and workflows: transliteration and bilingual dictionary.

(*)Translate into multiple languages at once – Translate into multiple languages with a single request to the Translator cloud service. The translate feature automatically
detects the language of the source content.

(*)Detect – Automatically detect the language of the text sent to the API to help decide which content should be sent for translation or not.

(*)Transliteration – Convert words and sentences from one script into another script. For instance, you can present Chinese characters in the Latin alphabet (PinYin) so
they can be read by non-Chinese audiences.

(*)Bilingual dictionary – Display alternative translations from or to English, examples of words in context to help you choose the perfect translation, and even 
examples of translated sentences using this word.


This project main motto is to translate texts from unknown language to known language and translate from one language to multiple languages. this service helps in achieving 
the same.
